iRobotStargazer_Navigator
=========================

This is a ROS package to move around an iRobot create based on the specified coordinates of the room. The localization is based on Stargazer (and associated ROS package) and the actuation is on the iRobot Creates wheels (iRobot ROS package). This code which is the controller ROS package, is related to a project in CPSLab and the whole project is in collaboration with Professor Georgios Fainekos, Shashank Srinivas, Parth Pandya. This ROS package was initially created by Parth by later was rewritten completely by myself to adapt to the new coordinate system and improve the low level control algorithm using a proportional feedback loop.
